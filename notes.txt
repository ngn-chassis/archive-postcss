It would be better to have at-rules return a css root instead of having them
directly modify the AST. For example, the constrain-width at-rule currently
replaces the initial rule and then injects media queries after it. Instead, it
should return a new root with media queries added to the end. The at-rules
process() function can then replace the at-rule itself with the new css.

^ This will make error handling easier and make for less repetition of code
since the mixins will not need to replace or remove at-rules.
