- Add ability to declare color and other variables in theme file

- maybe allow extension of component states as well as full components:
@chassis extend button.pill {
	...
}

- make separate component reset blocks for different box-models. This will
minimize the amount of incompatible style rules on different types of elements
versus using a shared component reset.
