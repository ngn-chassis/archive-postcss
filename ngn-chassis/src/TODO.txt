- image replacement mixin
- maybe some flexbox mixins if they can be done elegantly
- maybe some helper mixins for responsive embeds
- screenreader helpers
- add disabled states to all form controls

COMPONENT RESET
- make separate component reset blocks for different box-models. This will
  minimize the amount of incompatible style rules on different types of elements
  versus using a shared component reset.

COMPONENT EXTENSION
- consider ways of combining rulesets to shrink the size of the css

- maybe allow extension of component states as well as full components:
@chassis extend button.pill {
	...
}
